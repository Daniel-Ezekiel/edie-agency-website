Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo? 
   [See my Demo](https://edie-agency.netlify.app/)
- What was your experience?
   This challenge has been a real eye opener for me, I've seen my limitations and know what I need to improve on.
- What have you learned/improved?
   My use of media queries has become better, and with more practice will keep getting better. I used this challenge to get the hang of using CSS Grid for layouts and it has been a really fun experience.
- Your wisdom? :)
   Mobile first, always and forever!
